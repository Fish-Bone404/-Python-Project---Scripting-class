# Todo CLI with SQLite

## Purpose

This project is a small command line todo list manager that stores tasks in an SQLite database file.  
The goal is to have a quick way to add, list, complete, delete, and search tasks without opening a GUI app or website.

It is useful because:

- Tasks are saved in a single `todo.db` file that travels with the project.
- You can script it or combine it with other tools in the shell.
- It supports priorities and searching tasks with regular expressions.

This is different from the examples we used in class and from the earlier bash project.  
Here the focus is on argument parsing with subcommands, SQLite storage, and regex based search.

## Features

- Stores tasks in an SQLite database (no external server needed).
- Subcommands:
  - `add` add a new task.
  - `list` show open tasks or all tasks.
  - `complete` mark a task as done.
  - `delete` remove a task.
  - `search` find tasks whose description matches a regular expression.
- Supports three priorities: `low`, `normal`, `high`.
- Uses a regular expression for searching descriptions.
- Has `-h` and `--help` output from `argparse`.
- Handles bad input with clear error messages.

## Usage

Create and use the database with a few commands.

```bash
# add tasks
python3 todo_cli.py add "Write lab report" -p high
python3 todo_cli.py add "Clean kitchen" -p low

# list open tasks
python3 todo_cli.py list

# list all tasks including completed
python3 todo_cli.py list --all

# mark task id 1 as completed
python3 todo_cli.py complete 1

# delete task id 2
python3 todo_cli.py delete 2

# search tasks with a regex (case insensitive)
python3 todo_cli.py search "lab"
python3 todo_cli.py search "clean|wash" --all
